The Carbon Emissions Calculator is a C program that helps users estimate their annual CO2 emissions based on factors like electricity usage, transportation habits, and income. It provides a breakdown of emissions and compares them to the average Canadian, along with an estimate of the trees needed to offset the emissions.
