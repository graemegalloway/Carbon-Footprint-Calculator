# Carbon Emissions Calculator

## Overview
The Carbon Emissions Calculator is a C program designed to help users estimate their annual CO2 emissions based on various factors such as electricity consumption, gas usage, and transportation methods. By prompting users for input on their environmental behaviors and lifestyle choices, the program calculates and presents a breakdown of carbon emissions in a user-friendly table format. Additionally, it compares the user's emissions to the average Canadian emissions and provides an estimate of the number of trees needed to offset the carbon footprint. This tool aims to raise awareness about personal carbon emissions and encourage environmentally conscious decision-making.
